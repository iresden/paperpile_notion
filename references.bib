              structural and functional building blocks of human interphase
              chromosomes, yet the mechanisms of TAD formation remain unclear.
              Here, we propose that loop extrusion underlies TAD formation. In
              this process, cis-acting loop-extruding factors, likely cohesins,
              form progressively larger loops but stall at TAD boundaries due to
              interactions with boundary proteins, including CTCF. Using polymer
              simulations, we show that this model produces TADs and finer-scale
              features of Hi-C data. Each TAD emerges from multiple loops
              dynamically formed through extrusion, contrary to typical
              illustrations of single static loops. Loop extrusion both explains
              diverse experimental observations-including the preferential
              orientation of CTCF motifs, enrichments of architectural proteins
              at TAD boundaries, and boundary deletion experiments-and makes
              specific predictions for the depletion of CTCF versus cohesin.
              Finally, loop extrusion has potentially far-ranging consequences
              for processes such as enhancer-promoter interactions,
              orientation-specific chromosomal looping, and compaction of
              mitotic chromosomes.",

               loops during extrusion by condensin and cohesin. This even occurs
               for a single-chain version of cohesin in which the ring-forming

               Here, using the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, we generate cohesin

               the second week of gestation, when the embryo experiences a
               series of cell differentiation, proliferation, and migration
               processes encompassed under the term conceptus elongation.
               Conceptus elongation takes place following blastocyst hatching
               and involves a massive proliferation of the extraembryonic
               membranes trophoblast and hypoblast, and the formation of flat
               embryonic disc derived from the epiblast, which ultimately
               gastrulates generating the three germ layers. This process occurs
               prior to implantation and it is exclusive from ungulates, as
               embryos from other mammalian species such as rodents or humans
               implant right after hatching. The critical differences in embryo
               development between ungulates and mice, the most studied
               mammalian model, have precluded the identification of the genes
               governing lineage differentiation in livestock species.
               Furthermore, conceptus elongation has not been recapitulated in
               vitro, hindering the study of these cellular events. Luckily,
               recent advances on transcriptomics, genome modification and
               post-hatching in vitro culture are shedding light into this
               largely unknown developmental window, uncovering possible
               molecular markers to determine embryo quality. In this review, we
               summarize the events occurring during ungulate pre-implantation
               development, highlighting recent findings which reveal that
               several dogmas in Developmental Biology established by knock-out
               murine models do not hold true for other mammals, including
               humans and farm animals. The developmental failures associated to
               in vitro produced embryos in farm animals are also discussed

               quality, including molecular markers to assess proper lineage

               directly determine developmental potential circumventing the need

               biochemical reconstitution of cohesin activity in vitro has
               remained an unattained goal. Here we reconstitute cohesin loading
               onto DNA using purified fission yeast cohesin and its loader

               Incubation of cohesin with DNA leads to spontaneous topological

               the most well-studied epigenetic mechanisms in mammals with
               important functions in normal and disease biology.
               Disease-specific aberrant DNA methylation is a well-recognized
               hallmark of many complex diseases. Accordingly, various studies
               have focused on characterizing unique DNA methylation marks
               associated with distinct stages of disease development as they
               may serve as useful biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis,
               prediction of response to therapy, or disease monitoring.
               Recently, novel CpG dinucleotide modifications with potential
               regulatory roles such as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine,
               5-formylcytosine, and 5-carboxylcytosine have been described.
               These potential epigenetic marks cannot be distinguished from
               5-methylcytosine by many current strategies and may potentially
               compromise assessment and interpretation of methylation data. A
               large number of strategies have been described for the discovery
               and validation of DNA methylation-based biomarkers, each with its
               own advantages and limitations. These strategies can be
               classified into three main categories: restriction enzyme
               digestion, affinity-based analysis, and bisulfite modification.
               In general, candidate biomarkers are discovered using
               large-scale, genome-wide, methylation sequencing, and/or
               microarray-based profiling strategies. Following discovery,
               biomarker performance is validated in large independent cohorts
               using highly targeted locus-specific assays. There are still many
               challenges to the effective implementation of DNA
               methylation-based biomarkers. Emerging innovative methylation and
               hydroxymethylation detection strategies are focused on addressing
               these gaps in the field of epigenetics. The development of DNA
               methylation- and hydroxymethylation-based biomarkers is an

               Imprinting is found predominantly in placental mammals, and has

               exhibits three structural features, two of which are not shared
               by other chromosomes. First, like the chromosomes of many
               species, Xi forms compartments. Second, Xi is partitioned into
               two huge intervals, called ``superdomains,'' such that pairs of
               loci in the same superdomain tend to colocalize. The boundary
               between the superdomains lies near DXZ4, a macrosatellite repeat
               whose Xi allele extensively binds the protein CCCTC-binding
               factor. Third, Xi exhibits extremely large loops, up to 77

               super-resolution microscopy to analyse the spatial organization
               of a 4.5-megabases (Mb) region including Xist. We discover a
               series of discrete 200-kilobase to 1 Mb topologically associating
               domains (TADs), present both before and after cell
               differentiation and on the active and inactive X. TADs align

               have encountered this issue in various contexts, including the
               Einstein relation and fluctuation-dissipation theorems (Chap. 2
               and Chap. 10), Brownian ratchets (Chap. 4), and the law of mass
               action, and detailed balance (Chap. 3 and Chap. 5). The essential
               idea is that many stochastic dynamical phenomena in cell biology
               involve the relaxation to an equilibrium thermodynamic state,
               with the relaxation occurring on relevant biological time scales.
               It follows that in order to understand the dynamics of cellular
               structures such as the cytoskeleton, plasma membrane, and
               nucleus, it is necessary to consider the equilibrium and
               near-equilibrium behavior of the physical components underlying
               such structures. Therefore, in this chapter, we present a basic
               introduction to the statistical mechanics and dynamics of
               polymers, membranes, and polymer networks. In order to keep the
               material reasonably self-contained, we use the Boltzmann-Gibbs
               distribution and associated partition function as the starting
               point of our analysis. This also provides a relatively
               straightforward way of defining important quantities such as free

               question that remains unanswered today. Early biochemical and
               microscopic studies revealed the existence of chromatin domains
               and loops as a pervasive feature of interphase chromosomes, but
               the biological implications of such organizational features were
               obscure. Genome-wide analysis of pair-wise chromatin interactions

               episignature testing based on the cohort of patients tested
               through the EpiSign Clinical Testing Network. METHODS: The
               EpiSign assay utilized unsupervised clustering techniques and a
               support vector machine-based classification algorithm to compare
               each patient's genome-wide DNA methylation profile with the
               EpiSign Knowledge Database, yielding the result that was
               reported. An international working group, representing distinct
               EpiSign Clinical Testing Network health jurisdictions,
               collaborated to establish recommendations for interpretation and
               reporting of episignature testing. RESULTS: Among 2399 cases
               analyzed, 1667 cases underwent a comprehensive screen of
               validated episignatures, imprinting, and promoter regions,
               resulting in 18.7\% (312/1667) positive reports. The remaining
               732 referrals underwent targeted episignature analysis for
               assessment of sequence or copy-number variants (CNVs) of
               uncertain significance or for assessment of clinical diagnoses
               without confirmed molecular findings, and 32.4\% (237/732) were
               positive. Cases with detailed clinical information were
               highlighted to describe various utility scenarios for
               episignature testing. CONCLUSION: Clinical DNA methylation
               testing including episignatures, imprinting, and promoter
               analysis provided by an integrated network of clinical
               laboratories enables test standardization and demonstrates

               of the signatures. Our procedure reached 100\% specificity, but
               the sensitivities unexpectedly spanned a very large spectrum.
               While ATRX, DNMT3A, KMT2D, and NSD1 signatures displayed a 100\%
               sensitivity, CREBBP-RSTS and one of the CHD8 signatures reached
               <40\% sensitivity on our dataset. Remaining Cornelia de Lange
               syndrome, KMT2A, KDM5C and CHD7 signatures reached 70-100\%
               sensitivity at best with unstable performances, suffering from
               heterogeneous methylation profiles among cases and rare
               discordant samples. Our results call for cautiousness and
               demonstrate that episignatures do not perform equally well. Some
               signatures are ready for confident use in a diagnostic setting.
               Yet, it is imperative to characterise the actual validity
               perimeter and interpretation of each episignature with the help
               of larger validation sample sizes and in a broader set of
               episignatures.",

              genetic variants in ∼50\% of individuals with developmental and
              epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs). Aberrant changes in DNA
              methylation are implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders
              but remain unstudied in DEEs. Rare epigenetic variations
              (``epivariants'') can drive disease by modulating gene expression
              at single loci, whereas genome-wide DNA methylation changes can
              result in distinct ``episignature'' biomarkers for monogenic
              disorders in a growing number of rare diseases. Here, we
              interrogate the diagnostic utility of genome-wide DNA methylation
              array analysis on peripheral blood samples from 516 individuals
              with genetically unsolved DEEs who had previously undergone
              extensive genetic testing. We identified rare differentially
              methylated regions (DMRs) and explanatory episignatures to
              discover causative and candidate genetic etiologies in 10
              individuals. We then used long-read sequencing to identify DNA
              variants underlying rare DMRs, including one balanced
              translocation, three CG-rich repeat expansions, and two copy
              number variants. We also identify pathogenic sequence variants
              associated with episignatures; some had been missed by previous
              exome sequencing. Although most DEE genes lack known
              episignatures, the increase in diagnostic yield for DNA
              methylation analysis in DEEs is comparable to the added yield of
              genome sequencing. Finally, we refine an episignature for CHD2
              using an 850K methylation array which was further refined at
              higher CpG resolution using bisulfite sequencing to investigate
              potential insights into CHD2 pathophysiology. Our study
              demonstrates the diagnostic yield of genome-wide DNA methylation
              analysis to identify causal and candidate genetic causes as ∼2\%
              (10/516) for unsolved DEE cases.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: A subset of developmental disorders (DD) is
               characterized by disease-specific genome-wide methylation
               changes. These episignatures inform on the underlying pathogenic
               mechanisms and can be used to assess the pathogenicity of genomic
               variants as well as confirm clinical diagnoses. Currently, the
               detection of these episignature requires the use of indirect
               methylation profiling methodologies. We hypothesized that
               long-read whole genome sequencing would not only enable the
               detection of single nucleotide variants and structural variants
               but also episignatures. METHODS: Genome-wide nanopore sequencing
               was performed in 40 controls and 20 patients with confirmed or
               suspected episignature-associated DD, representing 13 distinct
               diseases. Following genomic variant and methylome calling,
               hierarchical clustering and dimensional reduction were used to
               determine the compatibility with microarray-based episignatures.
               Subsequently, we developed a support vector machine (SVM) for the
               detection of each DD. RESULTS: Nanopore sequencing-based
               methylome patterns were concordant with microarray-based
               episignatures. Our SVM-based classifier identified the
               episignatures in 17/19 patients with a (likely) pathogenic
               variant and none of the controls. The remaining patients in which
               no episignature was identified were also classified as controls
               by a commercial microarray assay. In addition, we identified all
               underlying pathogenic single nucleotide and structural variants
               and showed haplotype-aware skewed X-inactivation evaluation
               directs clinical interpretation. CONCLUSION: This
               proof-of-concept study demonstrates nanopore sequencing enables
               episignature detection. In addition, concurrent haplotyped
               genomic and epigenomic analyses leverage simultaneous detection
               of single nucleotide/structural variants, X-inactivation, and
               imprinting, consolidating a multi-step sequential process into a

               the pathogenicity of variants of uncertain significance (VUS).
               However, their sensitivity is limited due to their training on
               unambiguous cases with strong-effect variants so that the
               classification of variants with reduced effect size or in mosaic
               state may fail. Moreover, episignature evaluation of mosaics as a
               function of their degree of mosaicism has not been developed so
               far. We improved episignatures with respect to three categories.
               Applying (i) minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance feature
               selection we reduced their length by up to one order of magnitude
               without loss of accuracy. Performing (ii) repeated re-training of
               a support vector machine classifier by step-wise inclusion of
               cases in the training set that reached probability scores larger
               than 0.5, we increased the sensitivity of the
               episignature-classifiers by 30\%. In the newly diagnosed patients
               we confirmed the association between DNA methylation aberration
               and age at onset of KMT2B-deficient dystonia. Moreover, we found
               evidence for allelic series, including KMT2B-variants with
               moderate effects and comparatively mild phenotypes such as
               late-onset focal dystonia. Retrained classifiers also can detect
               mosaics that previously remained below the 0.5-threshold, as we
               showed for KMT2D-associated Kabuki syndrome. Conversely,
               episignature-classifiers are able to revoke erroneous exome calls
               of mosaicism, as we demonstrated by (iii) comparing presumed
               mosaic cases with a distribution of artificial in silico-mosaics
               that represented all the possible variation in degree of
               mosaicism, variant read sampling and methylation analysis.",

               investigated in mice, where the X chromosome of paternal origin
               (Xp) is silenced during early embryogenesis owing to imprinted
               expression of the regulatory RNA, Xist (X-inactive specific

               different strategies for initiating XCI. In rabbits and humans,
               the Xist homologue is not subject to imprinting and XCI begins

              conservation with its ancestral homologue the Y chromosome and the
              resulting difference in X-chromosome dosage between males and
              females is largely compensated for by X-chromosome inactivation.
              The process of inactivation is initiated by the long non-coding
              RNA X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) and achieved through
              interaction with multiple synergistic silencing pathways.
              Identification of Xist-interacting proteins has given insight into
              these processes yet the cascade of events from initiation to
              maintenance have still to be resolved. In particular, the
              initiation of inactivation in humans has been challenging to study
              as: it occurs very early in development; most human embryonic stem
              cell lines already have an inactive X; and the process seems to
              differ from mouse. Another difference between human and mouse X
              inactivation is the larger number of human genes that escape
              silencing. In humans over 20\% of X-linked genes continue to be
              expressed from the otherwise inactive X chromosome. We are only

              growing recognition that escapees contribute to sexually dimorphic
              traits. The unique biology and epigenetics of the X chromosome
              have often led to its exclusion from disease studies, yet the X
              constitutes 5\% of the genome and is an important contributor to

               during development of female embryos. This process has been
               termed X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). Inactivation of the

               is confined to the late stages of first meiotic prophase during

               gene's susceptibility to Xist-mediated silencing appears to be
               determined by a complex interplay of epigenetic and genomic
               features; however, the underlying rules remain poorly understood.
               We have quantified chromosome-wide gene silencing kinetics at the
               level of the nascent transcriptome using allele-specific
               Precision nuclear Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq). We have developed

               by gene density and distance to LINE elements, are the prime

               two distinct gene classes associated with different silencing

               which is known to activate the SPEN pathway, and a second class
               in which genes are premarked by Polycomb complexes and tend to
               rely on the B repeat in Xist for silencing, known to recruit
               Polycomb complexes during XCI. Moreover, a series of features
               associated with active transcriptional elongation and chromatin
               3D structure are enriched at rapidly silenced genes. Our

               DNA demethylation by repressing DNA methylation pathways and
               activating TET-mediated hydroxymethylation. Base-resolution
               methylome analysis reveals progressive DNA demethylation to basal
               levels in week 5-7 in vivo hPGCs. Concurrently, hPGCs undergo
               chromatin reorganization, X reactivation, and imprint erasure.
               Despite global hypomethylation, evolutionarily young and
               potentially hazardous retroelements, like SVA, remain methylated.
               Remarkably, some loci associated with metabolic and neurological
               disorders are also resistant to DNA demethylation, revealing
               potential for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance that may
               have phenotypic consequences. We provide comprehensive insight on
               early human germline transcriptional network and epigenetic
               reprogramming that subsequently impacts human development and
               disease.",

               DNA methylation specifically at CpG islands (CGIs). While the

               genomic DNA methylation patterns (called ``episignatures'').
               Peripheral blood episignatures can be used for diagnostic testing
               as well as for the interpretation of ambiguous genetic test
               results. We present here an approach to episignature mapping in
               42 genetic syndromes, which has allowed the identification of 34
               robust disease-specific episignatures. We examine emerging
               patterns of overlap, as well as similarities and hierarchical
               relationships across these episignatures, to highlight their key
               features as they are related to genetic heterogeneity, dosage

               a consequence of Mendelian inheritance of mutations in genes
               involved in DNA methylation, establishment of histone
               modifications, and chromatin remodeling (the ``epigenetic
               machinery''). The mechanistic cross-talk between histone
               modification and DNA methylation suggests that these syndromes
               might be expected to display specific DNA methylation signatures
               that are a reflection of those primary errors associated with
               chromatin dysregulation. Given the interrelated functions of
               these chromatin regulatory proteins, we sought to identify DNA
               methylation epi-signatures that could provide syndrome-specific
               biomarkers to complement standard clinical diagnostics. In the
               present study, we examined peripheral blood samples from a large
               cohort of individuals encompassing 14 Mendelian disorders
               displaying mutations in the genes encoding proteins of the
               epigenetic machinery. We demonstrated that specific but partially
               overlapping DNA methylation signatures are associated with many
               of these conditions. The degree of overlap among these
               epi-signatures is minimal, further suggesting that, consistent
               with the initial event, the downstream changes are unique to
               every syndrome. In addition, by combining these epi-signatures,
               we have demonstrated that a machine learning tool can be built to
               concurrently screen for multiple syndromes with high sensitivity
               and specificity, and we highlight the utility of this tool in
               solving ambiguous case subjects presenting with variants of
               unknown significance, along with its ability to generate accurate
               predictions for subjects presenting with the overlapping clinical
               and molecular features associated with the disruption of the

               dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by heterozygous
               loss-of-function alterations in the SIN3A gene. WITKOS has
               variable expressivity that commonly overlaps with other
               neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, we characterized a
               distinct DNA methylation epigenetic signature (episignature)
               distinguishing WITKOS from unaffected individuals as well as
               individuals with other neurodevelopmental disorders with
               episignatures and described 9 previously unpublished individuals
               with SIN3A haploinsufficiency. METHODS: We studied the phenotypic
               characteristics and the genome-wide DNA methylation in the
               peripheral blood samples of 20 individuals with heterozygous
               alterations in SIN3A. A total of 14 samples were used for the
               identification of the episignature and building of a predictive
               diagnostic biomarker, whereas the diagnostic model was used to
               investigate the methylation pattern of the remaining 6 samples.
               RESULTS: A predominantly hypomethylated DNA methylation profile
               specific to WITKOS was identified, and the classifier model was
               able to diagnose a previously unresolved test case. The
               episignature was sensitive enough to detect individuals with
               varying degrees of phenotypic severity carrying SIN3A
               haploinsufficient variants. CONCLUSION: We identified a novel,
               robust episignature in WITKOS due to SIN3A haploinsufficiency.
               This episignature has the potential to aid identification and

               patterns of DNA methylation down to single-nucleotide resolution.
               DNA methylation is the most researched epigenetic mark involved
               in various processes in the human cell, including gene regulation
               and development of diseases, such as cancer. Increasing numbers

               precipitation to the whole genome bisulfite sequencing. Many of
               those datasets are fully accessible for repeated analyses.
               Sequencing experiments have become routine in laboratories around
               the world, while analysis of outcoming data is still a challenge
               among the majority of scientists, since in many cases it requires
               advanced computational skills. Even though various tools are
               being created and published, guidelines for their selection are
               often not clear, especially to non-bioinformaticians with limited
               experience in computational analyses. Separate tools are often
               used for individual steps in the analysis, and these can be

               tools are combined into pipelines that are capable to complete
               all the essential steps to achieve the result. In the case of DNA

               genome-wide epigenetic discrimination of individuals, not just
               groups of samples. Furthermore, unlike the other approaches,

               5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), we demonstrate the preferential

               declined for constant spiked-in controls but increased for

               constructed starting with 1 ng of DNA, with the majority of

               making it possible to comprehensively investigate the role of DNA
               methylation. Several methods have been developed, such as Whole

               Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS), and enrichment-based methods
               including Methylation Dependent ImmunoPrecipitation followed by

               cost-prohibitive technology for a typical laboratory due to the
               required sequencing depth. We found that by integrating two
               enrichment-based methods that are complementary in nature (i.e.,
               MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq), we can significantly increase the
               efficiency of whole DNA methylome profiling. By using two
               recently developed computational algorithms (i.e., M\&M and

               genome-wide CpG methylation measurement at high coverage and high
               resolution, and robust predictions of differentially methylated
               regions. Thus, the combination of the two enrichment-based
               methods provides a cost-effective alternative to WGBS. In this

               None of these existing methods provides single-CpG resolution,

               methylCRF transformation of MeDIP-seq/MRE-seq was equivalent to a

               resolution. We used conventional bisulfite conversion, PCR,
               cloning, and sequencing to validate loci where our predictions do
               not agree with whole-genome bisulfite data, and in 11 out of 12

               with validated results than does whole-genome bisulfite

              stable DNA methylation patterns, with 70-80\% of all CpGs being
              methylated. Despite recent advances, we still have a limited
              understanding of when, where and how many CpGs participate in
              genomic regulation. Here we report the in-depth analysis of 42
              whole-genome bisulphite sequencing data sets across 30 diverse
              human cell and tissue types. We observe dynamic regulation for
              only 21.8\% of autosomal CpGs within a normal developmental
              context, most of which are distal to transcription start sites.
              These dynamic CpGs co-localize with gene regulatory elements,
              particularly enhancers and transcription-factor-binding sites,
              which allow identification of key lineage-specific regulators. In
              addition, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) often contain
              single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with cell-type-related
              diseases as determined by genome-wide association studies. The
              results also highlight the general inefficiency of whole-genome
              bisulphite sequencing, as 70-80\% of the sequencing reads across
              these data sets provided little or no relevant information about
              CpG methylation. To demonstrate further the utility of our DMR
              set, we use it to classify unknown samples and identify
              representative signature regions that recapitulate major DNA
              methylation dynamics. In summary, although in theory every CpG can
              change its methylation state, our results suggest that only a
              fraction does so as part of coordinated regulatory programs.
              Therefore, our selected DMRs can serve as a starting point to
              guide new, more effective reduced representation approaches to
              capture the most informative fraction of CpGs, as well as further

               bundle contacts between Polycomb regions. E-P stripes extending
               from the edge of domains predominantly link co-expressed loci,
               often in the absence of CTCF and cohesin occupancy. Acute
               inhibition of transcription disrupts these gene-related folding
               features without altering higher-order chromatin structures. Our
               study uncovers previously obscured finer-scale genome
               organization, establishing functional links between chromatin
               folding and gene regulation.",

               insights into chromosome folding in vivo. To overcome the limited
               resolution of prior studies, we extend a recently developed Hi-C
               variant, Micro-C, to map chromosome architecture at nucleosome
               resolution in human ESCs and fibroblasts. Micro-C robustly
               captures known features of chromosome folding including
               compartment organization, topologically associating domains, and
               interactions between CTCF binding sites. In addition, Micro-C
               provides a detailed map of nucleosome positions and localizes
               contact domain boundaries with nucleosomal precision. Compared to
               Hi-C, Micro-C exhibits an order of magnitude greater dynamic
               range, allowing the identification of ∼20,000 additional loops in
               each cell type. Many newly identified peaks are localized along
               extrusion stripes and form transitive grids, consistent with
               their anchors being pause sites impeding cohesin-dependent loop
               extrusion. Our analyses comprise the highest-resolution maps of
               chromosome folding in human cells to date, providing a valuable
               resource for studies of chromosome organization.",

               It is believed that insulator/boundary elements separate these
               domains. Here we report the identification and characterization
               of boundary elements that flank the transcriptionally repressed
               HMR locus in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Deletion of
               these boundary elements led to the spread of silenced chromatin,
               whereas the ectopic insertion of these elements between a
               silencer and a promoter blocked the repressive effects of the
               silencer on that promoter at HMR and at telomeres. Sequence
               analysis indicated that the boundary element contained a TY1 LTR,
               and a tRNA gene and mutational analysis has implicated the Smc
               proteins, which encode structural components of chromosomes, in
