               molecular diagnostics, both as tumor specific biomarkers for the
               early detection or post-therapeutic monitoring of cancer as well
               as prognostic and predictive biomarkers for therapeutic
               stratification. Particularly in the former, the accurate
               estimation of DNA methylation is of compelling importance.
               However, quantification of DNA methylation has many traps for the
               unwary, especially when heterogeneous methylation comprising
               multiple alleles with varied DNA methylation patterns
               (epialleles) is present. The frequent occurrence of heterogeneous
               methylation as distinct from a simple mixture of fully methylated
               and unmethylated alleles is generally not taken into account when
               DNA methylation is considered as a cancer biomarker. When
               heterogeneous DNA methylation is present, the proportion of
               methylated molecules is difficult to quantify without a method
               that allows the measurement of individual epialleles. In this

               to investigate DNA methylation, with an emphasis on the detection
               and measurement of heterogeneous DNA methylation. The adoption of
               digital approaches will enable the effective use of heterogeneous

               the most well-studied epigenetic mechanisms in mammals with
               important functions in normal and disease biology.
               Disease-specific aberrant DNA methylation is a well-recognized
               hallmark of many complex diseases. Accordingly, various studies
               have focused on characterizing unique DNA methylation marks
               associated with distinct stages of disease development as they
               may serve as useful biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis,
               prediction of response to therapy, or disease monitoring.
               Recently, novel CpG dinucleotide modifications with potential
               regulatory roles such as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine,
               5-formylcytosine, and 5-carboxylcytosine have been described.
               These potential epigenetic marks cannot be distinguished from
               5-methylcytosine by many current strategies and may potentially
               compromise assessment and interpretation of methylation data. A
               large number of strategies have been described for the discovery
               and validation of DNA methylation-based biomarkers, each with its
               own advantages and limitations. These strategies can be
               classified into three main categories: restriction enzyme
               digestion, affinity-based analysis, and bisulfite modification.
               In general, candidate biomarkers are discovered using
               large-scale, genome-wide, methylation sequencing, and/or
               microarray-based profiling strategies. Following discovery,
               biomarker performance is validated in large independent cohorts
               using highly targeted locus-specific assays. There are still many
               challenges to the effective implementation of DNA
               methylation-based biomarkers. Emerging innovative methylation and
               hydroxymethylation detection strategies are focused on addressing
               these gaps in the field of epigenetics. The development of DNA
               methylation- and hydroxymethylation-based biomarkers is an

               Unexpectedly, prevalent DNA hypermethylation, paralleled by
               H3K36me2/3, also occurs in nontranscribed regions in porcine and

               rodent H3K27me3 survives beyond genome activation. Coincidently,

               All the quantification results are compared with the

               Imprinting is found predominantly in placental mammals, and has

               species, Xi forms compartments. Second, Xi is partitioned into
               two huge intervals, called ``superdomains,'' such that pairs of
               loci in the same superdomain tend to colocalize. The boundary

               whose Xi allele extensively binds the protein CCCTC-binding
               factor. Third, Xi exhibits extremely large loops, up to 77

               A prime example of this concerns the mouse X-inactivation centre
               (Xic), which orchestrates the initiation of X-chromosome
               inactivation (XCI) by controlling the expression of the

               super-resolution microscopy to analyse the spatial organization
               of a 4.5-megabases (Mb) region including Xist. We discover a
               series of discrete 200-kilobase to 1 Mb topologically associating
               domains (TADs), present both before and after cell

               differentiated cell types at unprecedented resolution. We
               identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin interaction
               domains, which we term 'topological domains', as a pervasive
               structural feature of the genome organization. These domains
               correlate with regions of the genome that constrain the spread of
               heterochromatin. The domains are stable across different cell
               types and highly conserved across species, indicating that
               topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian
               genomes. Finally, we find that the boundaries of topological
               domains are enriched for the insulator binding protein CTCF,
               housekeeping genes, transfer RNAs and short interspersed element
               (SINE) retrotransposons, indicating that these factors may have a
               role in establishing the topological domain structure of the
               genome.",

               constructing stochastic models, it is important to ensure that
               these are consistent with equilibrium statistical mechanics. We
               have encountered this issue in various contexts, including the
               Einstein relation and fluctuation-dissipation theorems (Chap. 2
               and Chap. 10), Brownian ratchets (Chap. 4), and the law of mass
               action, and detailed balance (Chap. 3 and Chap. 5). The essential
               idea is that many stochastic dynamical phenomena in cell biology
               involve the relaxation to an equilibrium thermodynamic state,
               with the relaxation occurring on relevant biological time scales.
               It follows that in order to understand the dynamics of cellular
               structures such as the cytoskeleton, plasma membrane, and
               nucleus, it is necessary to consider the equilibrium and
               near-equilibrium behavior of the physical components underlying
               such structures. Therefore, in this chapter, we present a basic
               introduction to the statistical mechanics and dynamics of
               polymers, membranes, and polymer networks. In order to keep the
               material reasonably self-contained, we use the Boltzmann-Gibbs
               distribution and associated partition function as the starting
               point of our analysis. This also provides a relatively
               straightforward way of defining important quantities such as free
               energy, entropy, and the chemical potential (Chap. 1). For a more
               detailed and general introduction to statistical mechanics; see
               Refs. [178, 489]. Extensive material on polymer physics can be
               found in Refs. [250, 251, 775], whereas the physics of membranes
               is covered in Refs. [540, 782]. Finally, Ref. [87] provides a

               episignature testing based on the cohort of patients tested
               through the EpiSign Clinical Testing Network. METHODS: The
               EpiSign assay utilized unsupervised clustering techniques and a
               support vector machine-based classification algorithm to compare
               each patient's genome-wide DNA methylation profile with the
               EpiSign Knowledge Database, yielding the result that was
               reported. An international working group, representing distinct
               EpiSign Clinical Testing Network health jurisdictions,
               collaborated to establish recommendations for interpretation and
               reporting of episignature testing. RESULTS: Among 2399 cases
               analyzed, 1667 cases underwent a comprehensive screen of
               validated episignatures, imprinting, and promoter regions,
               resulting in 18.7\% (312/1667) positive reports. The remaining
               732 referrals underwent targeted episignature analysis for
               assessment of sequence or copy-number variants (CNVs) of
               uncertain significance or for assessment of clinical diagnoses
               without confirmed molecular findings, and 32.4\% (237/732) were
               positive. Cases with detailed clinical information were
               highlighted to describe various utility scenarios for
               episignature testing. CONCLUSION: Clinical DNA methylation
               testing including episignatures, imprinting, and promoter
               analysis provided by an integrated network of clinical
               laboratories enables test standardization and demonstrates

               find that the observed contact domains are inconsistent with the

               Hi-C data and novel mathematical theorems, we show that contact
               domains are also not consistent with a fractal globule. Instead,
               we use physical simulations to study two models of genome
               folding. In one, intermonomer attraction during polymer
               condensation leads to formation of an anisotropic ``tension
               globule.'' In the other, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin

               observations, such as why loops tend not to overlap and why the
               CTCF-binding motifs at pairs of loop anchors lie in the
               convergent orientation. Finally, we perform 13 genome-editing
               experiments examining the effect of altering CTCF-binding sites
               on chromatin folding. The convergent rule correctly predicts the
