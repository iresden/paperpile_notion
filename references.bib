              structural and functional building blocks of human interphase
              chromosomes, yet the mechanisms of TAD formation remain unclear.
              Here, we propose that loop extrusion underlies TAD formation. In
              this process, cis-acting loop-extruding factors, likely cohesins,
              form progressively larger loops but stall at TAD boundaries due to
              interactions with boundary proteins, including CTCF. Using polymer
              simulations, we show that this model produces TADs and finer-scale
              features of Hi-C data. Each TAD emerges from multiple loops
              dynamically formed through extrusion, contrary to typical
              illustrations of single static loops. Loop extrusion both explains
              diverse experimental observations-including the preferential
              orientation of CTCF motifs, enrichments of architectural proteins
              at TAD boundaries, and boundary deletion experiments-and makes
              specific predictions for the depletion of CTCF versus cohesin.
              Finally, loop extrusion has potentially far-ranging consequences
              for processes such as enhancer-promoter interactions,
              orientation-specific chromosomal looping, and compaction of
              mitotic chromosomes.",

               loop lifetime of approximately 10 to 30 minutes. Our results

               Disease-specific aberrant DNA methylation is a well-recognized
               hallmark of many complex diseases. Accordingly, various studies
               have focused on characterizing unique DNA methylation marks

               may serve as useful biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis,
               prediction of response to therapy, or disease monitoring.
               Recently, novel CpG dinucleotide modifications with potential
               regulatory roles such as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine,
               5-formylcytosine, and 5-carboxylcytosine have been described.
               These potential epigenetic marks cannot be distinguished from
               5-methylcytosine by many current strategies and may potentially
               compromise assessment and interpretation of methylation data. A

               own advantages and limitations. These strategies can be
               classified into three main categories: restriction enzyme
               digestion, affinity-based analysis, and bisulfite modification.
               In general, candidate biomarkers are discovered using
               large-scale, genome-wide, methylation sequencing, and/or
               microarray-based profiling strategies. Following discovery,

               species, Xi forms compartments. Second, Xi is partitioned into
               two huge intervals, called ``superdomains,'' such that pairs of
               loci in the same superdomain tend to colocalize. The boundary
               between the superdomains lies near DXZ4, a macrosatellite repeat
               whose Xi allele extensively binds the protein CCCTC-binding
               factor. Third, Xi exhibits extremely large loops, up to 77

              Functional studies in transgenic mouse cells show that XACT

               A prime example of this concerns the mouse X-inactivation centre
               (Xic), which orchestrates the initiation of X-chromosome
               inactivation (XCI) by controlling the expression of the
               non-protein-coding Xist transcript. The extent of Xic sequences
               required for the proper regulation of Xist remains unknown. Here
               we use chromosome conformation capture carbon-copy (5C) and
               super-resolution microscopy to analyse the spatial organization
               of a 4.5-megabases (Mb) region including Xist. We discover a
               series of discrete 200-kilobase to 1 Mb topologically associating
               domains (TADs), present both before and after cell
               differentiation and on the active and inactive X. TADs align
               with, but do not rely on, several domain-wide features of the
               epigenome, such as H3K27me3 or H3K9me2 blocks and
               lamina-associated domains. TADs also align with coordinately

               ectopic chromosomal contacts and long-range transcriptional
               misregulation. The Xist/Tsix sense/antisense unit illustrates how
               TADs enable the spatial segregation of oppositely regulated
               chromosomal neighbourhoods, with the respective promoters of Xist
               and Tsix lying in adjacent TADs, each containing their known
               positive regulators. We identify a novel distal regulatory region
               of Tsix within its TAD, which produces a long intervening RNA,
               Linx. In addition to uncovering a new principle of cis-regulatory
               architecture of mammalian chromosomes, our study sets the stage
               for the full genetic dissection of the X-inactivation centre.",

               distinct chromosome territories, and numerous models have been
               proposed for how chromosomes fold within chromosome territories.
               These models, however, provide only few mechanistic details about
               the relationship between higher order chromatin structure and
               genome function. Recent advances in genomic technologies have led
               to rapid advances in the study of three-dimensional genome
               organization. In particular, Hi-C has been introduced as a method
               for identifying higher order chromatin interactions genome wide.

               constructing stochastic models, it is important to ensure that
               these are consistent with equilibrium statistical mechanics. We
               have encountered this issue in various contexts, including the
               Einstein relation and fluctuation-dissipation theorems (Chap. 2
               and Chap. 10), Brownian ratchets (Chap. 4), and the law of mass
               action, and detailed balance (Chap. 3 and Chap. 5). The essential
               idea is that many stochastic dynamical phenomena in cell biology
               involve the relaxation to an equilibrium thermodynamic state,
               with the relaxation occurring on relevant biological time scales.
               It follows that in order to understand the dynamics of cellular
               structures such as the cytoskeleton, plasma membrane, and
               nucleus, it is necessary to consider the equilibrium and
               near-equilibrium behavior of the physical components underlying
               such structures. Therefore, in this chapter, we present a basic
               introduction to the statistical mechanics and dynamics of
               polymers, membranes, and polymer networks. In order to keep the
               material reasonably self-contained, we use the Boltzmann-Gibbs
               distribution and associated partition function as the starting
               point of our analysis. This also provides a relatively
               straightforward way of defining important quantities such as free
               energy, entropy, and the chemical potential (Chap. 1). For a more
               detailed and general introduction to statistical mechanics; see
               Refs. [178, 489]. Extensive material on polymer physics can be

               is covered in Refs. [540, 782]. Finally, Ref. [87] provides a

               each patient's genome-wide DNA methylation profile with the
               EpiSign Knowledge Database, yielding the result that was
               reported. An international working group, representing distinct

               collaborated to establish recommendations for interpretation and
               reporting of episignature testing. RESULTS: Among 2399 cases
               analyzed, 1667 cases underwent a comprehensive screen of
               validated episignatures, imprinting, and promoter regions,
               resulting in 18.7\% (312/1667) positive reports. The remaining
               732 referrals underwent targeted episignature analysis for
               assessment of sequence or copy-number variants (CNVs) of
               uncertain significance or for assessment of clinical diagnoses

               maps of mammalian genomes. Here, we combine these maps with new
               Hi-C, microscopy, and genome-editing experiments to study the
               physical structure of chromatin fibers, domains, and loops. We
               find that the observed contact domains are inconsistent with the
               equilibrium state for an ordinary condensed polymer. Combining
               Hi-C data and novel mathematical theorems, we show that contact
               domains are also not consistent with a fractal globule. Instead,
               we use physical simulations to study two models of genome
               folding. In one, intermonomer attraction during polymer
               condensation leads to formation of an anisotropic ``tension
               globule.'' In the other, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin
               act together to extrude unknotted loops during interphase. Both
               models are consistent with the observed contact domains and with
               the observation that contact domains tend to form inside loops.
               However, the extrusion model explains a far wider array of
               observations, such as why loops tend not to overlap and why the
               CTCF-binding motifs at pairs of loop anchors lie in the
               convergent orientation. Finally, we perform 13 genome-editing
               experiments examining the effect of altering CTCF-binding sites
               on chromatin folding. The convergent rule correctly predicts the
               affected loops in every case. Moreover, the extrusion model
               accurately predicts in silico the 3D maps resulting from each
               experiment using only the location of CTCF-binding sites in the
               WT. Thus, we show that it is possible to disrupt, restore, and
               move loops and domains using targeted mutations as small as a
               single base pair.",

               that the location and relative orientations of CBSs determine the

              methylation are implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders
              but remain unstudied in DEEs. Rare epigenetic variations
              (``epivariants'') can drive disease by modulating gene expression
              at single loci, whereas genome-wide DNA methylation changes can
              result in distinct ``episignature'' biomarkers for monogenic
              disorders in a growing number of rare diseases. Here, we
              interrogate the diagnostic utility of genome-wide DNA methylation
              array analysis on peripheral blood samples from 516 individuals
              with genetically unsolved DEEs who had previously undergone
              extensive genetic testing. We identified rare differentially
              methylated regions (DMRs) and explanatory episignatures to
              discover causative and candidate genetic etiologies in 10
              individuals. We then used long-read sequencing to identify DNA
              variants underlying rare DMRs, including one balanced
              translocation, three CG-rich repeat expansions, and two copy
              number variants. We also identify pathogenic sequence variants
              associated with episignatures; some had been missed by previous
              exome sequencing. Although most DEE genes lack known
              episignatures, the increase in diagnostic yield for DNA
              methylation analysis in DEEs is comparable to the added yield of
              genome sequencing. Finally, we refine an episignature for CHD2
              using an 850K methylation array which was further refined at
              higher CpG resolution using bisulfite sequencing to investigate
              potential insights into CHD2 pathophysiology. Our study
              demonstrates the diagnostic yield of genome-wide DNA methylation

               characterized by disease-specific genome-wide methylation
               changes. These episignatures inform on the underlying pathogenic
               mechanisms and can be used to assess the pathogenicity of genomic
               variants as well as confirm clinical diagnoses. Currently, the
               detection of these episignature requires the use of indirect
               methylation profiling methodologies. We hypothesized that
               long-read whole genome sequencing would not only enable the
               detection of single nucleotide variants and structural variants
               but also episignatures. METHODS: Genome-wide nanopore sequencing
               was performed in 40 controls and 20 patients with confirmed or
               suspected episignature-associated DD, representing 13 distinct
               diseases. Following genomic variant and methylome calling,
               hierarchical clustering and dimensional reduction were used to
               determine the compatibility with microarray-based episignatures.
               Subsequently, we developed a support vector machine (SVM) for the
               detection of each DD. RESULTS: Nanopore sequencing-based
               methylome patterns were concordant with microarray-based
               episignatures. Our SVM-based classifier identified the
               episignatures in 17/19 patients with a (likely) pathogenic

               the pathogenicity of variants of uncertain significance (VUS).
               However, their sensitivity is limited due to their training on
               unambiguous cases with strong-effect variants so that the
               classification of variants with reduced effect size or in mosaic
               state may fail. Moreover, episignature evaluation of mosaics as a
               function of their degree of mosaicism has not been developed so
               far. We improved episignatures with respect to three categories.
               Applying (i) minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance feature
               selection we reduced their length by up to one order of magnitude
               without loss of accuracy. Performing (ii) repeated re-training of
               a support vector machine classifier by step-wise inclusion of
               cases in the training set that reached probability scores larger
               than 0.5, we increased the sensitivity of the
               episignature-classifiers by 30\%. In the newly diagnosed patients
               we confirmed the association between DNA methylation aberration
               and age at onset of KMT2B-deficient dystonia. Moreover, we found
               evidence for allelic series, including KMT2B-variants with
               moderate effects and comparatively mild phenotypes such as
               late-onset focal dystonia. Retrained classifiers also can detect
               mosaics that previously remained below the 0.5-threshold, as we
               showed for KMT2D-associated Kabuki syndrome. Conversely,
               episignature-classifiers are able to revoke erroneous exome calls
               of mosaicism, as we demonstrated by (iii) comparing presumed
               mosaic cases with a distribution of artificial in silico-mosaics
               that represented all the possible variation in degree of

               of these factors on higher-order chromatin organization, as well
               as the transcriptome. We observed a general loss of local
               chromatin interactions upon disruption of cohesin, but the
               topological domains remain intact. However, we found that
               depletion of CTCF not only reduced intradomain interactions but
               also increased interdomain interactions. Furthermore, distinct
               groups of genes become misregulated upon depletion of cohesin and
               CTCF. Taken together, these observations suggest that CTCF and

               gene regulation.",

               higher-order structures, but how important this function is for
               determining overall chromosome architecture and how the process
               is regulated are not well understood. Using conditional
               mutagenesis in the mouse, here we show that depletion of the
               cohesin-associated protein Wapl stably locks cohesin on DNA,
               leads to clustering of cohesin in axial structures, and causes
               chromatin condensation in interphase chromosomes. These findings
               reveal that the stability of cohesin-DNA interactions is an
               important determinant of chromatin structure, and indicate that
               cohesin has an architectural role in interphase chromosome
               territories. Furthermore, we show that regulation of cohesin-DNA
               interactions by Wapl is important for embryonic development,
               expression of genes such as c-myc (also known as Myc), and cell
               cycle progression. In mitosis, Wapl-mediated release of cohesin
               from DNA is essential for proper chromosome segregation and
               protects cohesin from cleavage by the protease separase, thus
               enabling mitotic exit in the presence of functional cohesin
               complexes.",
