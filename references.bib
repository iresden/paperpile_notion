               cellular and molecular changes underlying lung alveolar damage is
               limited. Here, we integrate single cell transcriptomic data of
               COVID-19 and donor lung tissue with spatial transcriptomic data
               stratifying histopathological stages of diffuse alveolar damage.
               We identify changes in cellular composition across progressive
               damage, including waves of molecularly distinct macrophages and
               depletion of epithelial and endothelial populations. Predicted
               markers of pathological states identify immunoregulatory
               signatures, including IFN-alpha and metallothionein signatures in
               early damage, and fibrosis-related collagens in late damage.
               Furthermore, we predict a fibrinolytic shutdown via endothelial
               upregulation of SERPINE1/PAI-1. Cell-cell interaction analysis
               revealed macrophage-derived SPP1/osteopontin signalling as a key

               RNA-seq experiments, not all reads associated with one cell
               barcode originate from the encapsulated cell. Such background
               noise is attributed to spillage from cell-free ambient RNA or
               barcode swapping events. RESULTS: Here, we characterize this
               background noise exemplified by three scRNA-seq and two snRNA-seq
               replicates of mouse kidneys. For each experiment, cells from two
               mouse subspecies are pooled, allowing to identify cross-genotype
               contaminating molecules and thus profile background noise.
               Background noise is highly variable across replicates and cells,
               making up on average 3-35\% of the total counts (UMIs) per cell
               and we find that noise levels are directly proportional to the
               specificity and detectability of marker genes. In search of the
               source of background noise, we find multiple lines of evidence
               that the majority of background molecules originates from ambient
               RNA. Finally, we use our genotype-based estimates to evaluate the
               performance of three methods (CellBender, DecontX, SoupX) that
               are designed to quantify and remove background noise. We find
               that CellBender provides the most precise estimates of background
               noise levels and also yields the highest improvement for marker
               gene detection. By contrast, clustering and classification of
               cells are fairly robust towards background noise and only small
               improvements can be achieved by background removal that may come
               at the cost of distortions in fine structure. CONCLUSIONS: Our
               findings help to better understand the extent, sources and impact
               of background noise in single-cell experiments and provide
               guidance on how to deal with it.",

               currently no reliable treatments to prevent scarring. In contrast

               healing remain largely unknown. For some time, it has been known

               Such systematic background noise can lead to batch effects and

               mesenchymal buds, which develop into fully formed limbs over the
               subsequent months1. This process is orchestrated by numerous
               temporally and spatially restricted gene expression programmes,
               making congenital alterations in phenotype common2. Decades of
               work with model organisms have defined the fundamental mechanisms
               underlying vertebrate limb development, but an in-depth
               characterization of this process in humans has yet to be
               performed. Here we detail human embryonic limb development across
               space and time using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. We
               demonstrate extensive diversification of cells from a few
               multipotent progenitors to myriad differentiated cell states,
               including several novel cell populations. We uncover two waves of
               human muscle development, each characterized by different cell
               states regulated by separate gene expression programmes, and
               identify musculin (MSC) as a key transcriptional repressor
               maintaining muscle stem cell identity. Through assembly of

               uncover transcriptionally and spatially distinct populations of
               the mesenchyme in the autopod. Finally, we perform single-cell
               RNA sequencing on mouse embryonic limbs to facilitate

                 function, partly due to accumulated molecular damage. Human
                 skin undergoes both chronological aging and environmental
                 degradation, particularly UV-induced photoaging. Detrimental
                 structural and physiological changes caused by aging include
                 epidermal thinning due to stem cell depletion and dermal
                 atrophy associated with decreased collagen production. Here, we
                 present a comprehensive single-cell atlas of skin aging,
                 analyzing samples from young, middle-aged, and elderly
                 individuals, including both sun-exposed and sun-protected
                 areas. This atlas reveals age-related cellular composition and
                 function changes across various skin cell types, including
                 epidermal stem cells, fibroblasts, hair follicles, and
                 endothelial cells. Using our atlas, we have identified basal
                 stem cells as a highly variable population across aging, more
                 so than other skin cell populations such as fibroblasts. In
                 basal stem cells, we identified ATF3 as a novel regulator of
                 skin aging. ATF3 is a transcriptional factor for genes involved
                 in the aging process, with its expression reduced by 20\%
                 during aging. Based on this discovery, we have developed an
                 innovative mRNA-based treatment to mitigate the effects of skin
                 aging. Cell senescence decreased 25\% in skin cells treated
                 with ATF3 mRNA, and we observed an over 20\% increase in
                 proliferation in treated basal stem cells. Importantly, we also
                 found crosstalk between keratinocytes and fibroblasts as a
                 critical component of therapeutic interventions, with ATF3
                 rescue of basal cells significantly enhancing fibroblast
                 collagen production by approximately 200\%. We conclude that
                 ATF3-targeted mRNA treatment effectively reverses the effects
                 of skin aging by modulating specific cellular mechanisms,
                 offering a novel, targeted approach to human skin rejuvenation.",

               including macrophages, but whether they act solely in immunity or
               have additional functions in morphogenesis is unclear. Here we
               assembled a comprehensive multi-omics reference atlas of prenatal
               human skin (7-17 post-conception weeks), combining single-cell
               and spatial transcriptomics data, to characterize the
               microanatomical tissue niches of the skin. This atlas revealed
               that crosstalk between non-immune and immune cells underpins the
               formation of hair follicles, is implicated in scarless wound
               healing and is crucial for skin angiogenesis. We systematically
               compared a hair-bearing skin organoid (SkO) model derived from
               human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells to
               prenatal and adult skin1. The SkO model closely recapitulated in
               vivo skin epidermal and dermal cell types during hair follicle
               development and expression of genes implicated in the
               pathogenesis of genetic hair and skin disorders. However, the SkO
               model lacked immune cells and had markedly reduced endothelial
               cell heterogeneity and quantity. Our in vivo prenatal skin cell
               atlas indicated that macrophages and macrophage-derived growth
               factors have a role in driving endothelial development. Indeed,
               vascular network remodelling was enhanced following transfer of
               autologous macrophages derived from induced pluripotent stem
               cells into SkO cultures. Innate immune cells are therefore key
               players in skin morphogenesis beyond their conventional role in

               non-immune cells.",

               measurement of cells under native temporal dynamics and in their
               native spatial tissue niche. Optimal transport has emerged as a

               optimal transport applications are unable to incorporate

               that supports multimodality across all applications. We

               embryos across 20 time points. To illustrate the capability of

               biomedical research over the past decade, particularly in
               developmental biology, cancer, immunology, and neuroscience. Most
               commercially available scRNA-seq protocols require cells to be
               recovered intact and viable from tissue. This has precluded many
               cell types from study and largely destroys the spatial context
               that could otherwise inform analyses of cell identity and
               function. An increasing number of commercially available
               platforms now facilitate spatially resolved, high-dimensional
               assessment of gene transcription, known as 'spatial
               transcriptomics'. Here, we introduce different classes of method,
               which either record the locations of hybridized mRNA molecules in
               tissue, image the positions of cells themselves prior to
               assessment, or employ spatial arrays of mRNA probes of
               pre-determined location. We review sizes of tissue area that can
               be assessed, their spatial resolution, and the number and types
               of genes that can be profiled. We discuss if tissue preservation
               influences choice of platform, and provide guidance on whether
               specific platforms may be better suited to discovery screens or
               hypothesis testing. Finally, we introduce bioinformatic methods
               for analysing spatial transcriptomic data, including
               pre-processing, integration with existing scRNA-seq data, and
               inference of cell-cell interactions. Spatial -omics methods are
               already improving our understanding of human tissues in research,
               diagnostic, and therapeutic settings. To build upon these recent
               advancements, we provide entry-level guidance for those seeking
               to employ spatial transcriptomics in their own biomedical

               for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain
               algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that
               largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield
               arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case,
               communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the
               algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe
               that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to
               16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the
               Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields
               communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we
               prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it

               algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find
               that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm

               reaction triggered by common medications and is an emerging
               public health issue1-3. Patients with TEN undergo severe and
               sudden epidermal detachment caused by keratinocyte cell death.
               Although molecular mechanisms that drive keratinocyte cell death
               have been proposed, the main drivers remain unknown, and there is
               no effective therapy for TEN4-6. Here, to systematically map
               molecular changes that are associated with TEN and identify
               potential druggable targets, we utilized deep visual proteomics,
               which provides single-cell-based, cell-type-resolution
               proteomics7,8. We analysed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
               archived skin tissue biopsies of three types of cutaneous drug
               reactions with varying severity and quantified more than 5,000
               proteins in keratinocytes and skin-infiltrating immune cells.
               This revealed a marked enrichment of type I and type II
               interferon signatures in the immune cell and keratinocyte
               compartment of patients with TEN, as well as phosphorylated STAT1
               activation. Targeted inhibition with the pan-JAK inhibitor
               tofacitinib in vitro reduced keratinocyte-directed cytotoxicity.
               In vivo oral administration of tofacitinib, baricitinib or the
               JAK1-specific inhibitors abrocitinib or upadacitinib ameliorated
               clinical and histological disease severity in two distinct mouse

               was safe and associated with rapid cutaneous re-epithelialization
               and recovery in seven patients with TEN. This study uncovers the
               JAK/STAT and interferon signalling pathways as key pathogenic

              the number of GRN inference methods, datasets, and evaluation
              metrics. The absence of a universally accepted ground truth
              further complicates the evaluation, requiring continuous
              refinement of benchmarking strategies. In addition, regulatory
              interactions are highly context-specific and vary between
              perturbations, cell types, tissues, and organisms. However,
              current benchmarks do not account for this complexity, limiting
              their applicability in personalized medicine. Here, we introduce
              geneRNIB, a comprehensive GRN benchmarking framework built on
              three key principles: context-specific evaluation, continuous
              integration, and holistic assessment in the absence of a true
              reference network. geneRNIB enables the seamless incorporation of
              new algorithms, datasets, and evaluation metrics to reflect
              ongoing developments. In the current version, we systematically
              integrated and assessed ten GRN inference methods, spanning
              single- and multiomics approaches across five diverse datasets
              including thousands of perturbation scenarios. We introduced eight
              novel metrics specifically designed to assess context-specific
              causal inference. Our findings indicate that simple models with
              fewer assumptions often outperformed more complex pipelines.
              Notably, gene expression-based correlation algorithms yielded
              better results than more advanced approaches incorporating prior
              datasets or pre-trained on large datasets. In addition, we
              identified several potential factors that influence the
              performance of GRN inference and offered actionable guidelines for
              the future development of the method. By addressing these critical

               grafting. However, their production requires about one month of

               for the treatment of patients with severe skin defects. With the

               bioreactor setup that applies cyclic biaxial tension to collagen
               hydrogels for skin tissue engineering. By reliably controlling
               the time history of mechanical loading, the dynamic culturing
               results in a three-fold increase in collagen hydrogel stiffness
               and stimulates the embedded fibroblasts to enter the cell cycle.
               As a result, the number of fibroblasts is increased by 75\%
               compared to under corresponding static culturing. Enhanced
               fibroblast proliferation promotes expression of dermal
               extracellular matrix proteins, keratinocyte proliferation, and
               the early establishment of the epidermis. The time required for
               early tissue maturation can therefore be reduced by one week.
               Analysis of the separate effects of cyclic loading, matrix
               stiffening, and interstitial fluid flow indicates that cyclic
               deformation is the dominant biophysical factor determining
               fibroblast proliferation, while tissue stiffening plays a lesser
               role. Local differences in the direction of deformation (in-plane
               equibiaxial vs. uniaxial strain) influence fibroblast orientation
               but not proliferation, nor the resulting tissue properties.
               Importantly, dynamic culturing does not activate fibroblast
               differentiation into myofibroblasts. The present work
               demonstrates that control of mechanobiological cues can be very
               effective in driving cell response toward a shorter production

               Spatial organization of cellular differentiation may be achieved

  abstract    = "Summary Human prenatal skin is populated by innate immune cells
                 including macrophages, and whether they act solely in immunity
                 or have additional functions in morphogenesis is unclear. We
                 assembled the first comprehensive multi-omic reference atlas of
                 prenatal human skin (7-16 post-conception weeks), combining
                 single cell and spatial transcriptomic data, to characterise
                 the skin’s microenvironmental cellular organisation. This
                 revealed that crosstalk between non-immune and immune cells
                 underpins formation of hair follicles, has implications for
                 scarless wound healing, and is critical for skin angiogenesis.
                 We benchmarked a skin organoid model, derived from human
                 embryonic stem (ES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells,
                 against prenatal and adult skin, demonstrating close
                 recapitulation of the epidermal and dermal skin components
                 during hair follicle development. Notably, the skin organoid
                 lacked immune cells and had markedly diminished endothelial
                 cell heterogeneity and quantity. From our in vivo skin cell
                 atlas data, we found that macrophages and macrophage-derived
                 growth factors play a key role in driving endothelial
                 development prenatally. Indeed, vascular network formation was
                 enhanced following transfer of autologous iPS-derived
                 macrophages into both endothelial cell angiogenesis assays and
                 skin organoid cultures. In summary, innate immune cells
                 moonlight as key players in skin morphogenesis beyond their
                 conventional immune roles, a function they achieve via
                 extensive crosstalk with non-immune cells. Finally, we
                 leveraged our human prenatal skin cell atlas to further our
                 understanding of the pathogenesis of genetic hair and skin
                 disorders.",

               been challenging in the past, but recent advances in single-cell
               and spatial genomics, together with the co-ordinated efforts of
               the Human Cell Atlas and other initiatives, have led to new
               studies that map the development of the human immune system in
               unprecedented detail. In this Review, we consider the timings,
               transitions, cell types and tissue microenvironments that are
               crucial for building the human immune system. We also compare and
               contrast the human system with model species and in vitro
               systems, and discuss how an understanding of prenatal immune
               system development will improve our knowledge of human disease.",

               this approach captures only a static snapshot at a point in time,

               be directly estimated by distinguishing between unspliced and
               spliced mRNAs in common single-cell RNA sequencing protocols. RNA
               velocity is a high-dimensional vector that predicts the future

               assume that all acquired RNAs are endogenous to cells. However,
               any cell-free RNAs contained within the input solution are also
               captured by these assays. This sequencing of cell-free RNA
               constitutes a background contamination that confounds the
               biological interpretation of single-cell transcriptomic data.
               RESULTS: We demonstrate that contamination from this ``soup'' of
               cell-free RNAs is ubiquitous, with experiment-specific variations
               in composition and magnitude. We present a method, SoupX, for
               quantifying the extent of the contamination and estimating
               ``background-corrected'' cell expression profiles that seamlessly
               integrate with existing downstream analysis tools. Applying this
               method to several datasets using multiple droplet sequencing
               technologies, we demonstrate that its application improves
               biological interpretation of otherwise misleading data, as well

               SoupX, a tool for removing ambient RNA contamination from
               droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing experiments. This tool
               has broad applicability, and its application can improve the
               biological utility of existing and future datasets.",
